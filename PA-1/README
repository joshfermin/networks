Simple web server
Code inspired from: tinyhttpd-0.1.0 and rosetta code.

To run: 
	make clean
	make
	./webserver

Web server currently handles: 
	png, text, jpg, and html files
	500, 501, 404, and 400 errors

Parsing logic works for content types and port number.

Compiled on a macintosh with gcc. 

To test pipeline support, set the port to any number higher than 1024 and then run the
following command replacing <your port number> with the one you chose:
	(echo -en "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n Host: localhost \nConnection: keep-alive\n\nGET
	/index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\n\n"; sleep 10) | telnet localhost <your port number>
